## How to Contact Team Members

### Slack Communication

**Usage Examples**:

```bash
# Check for relevant messages (no setup needed)
.tools/slack_rest_client.py 10

# Send a message to the team
.tools/slack_rest_client.py send_message "Implementation complete, ready for review"
```

### Direct Mentions

Use `@Agent-Name` in Slack to get their attention:

- `@{AGENT_RED} can you run the tests?`
- `@{AGENT_BLACK} is the deployment ready?`
- `@{AGENT_GREEN} what's the build status?`

### Git Branch Strategy

**CRITICAL**: All pull requests MUST target the `dev` branch, never `main`.

- **Feature branches**: Create from `dev` branch
- **Pull requests**: Always target `dev` branch 
- **Deployment**: `dev` → staging, `main` → production
- **Example**: `gh pr create --base dev --title "Feature Title"`

**NEVER target `main` branch directly** - this bypasses our staging workflow and can disrupt production deployments.

### Important Note:

Do not ever try to run `sudo`. It will crash your session.

# Agent Instructions

## Agent Role & Expertise

You are a **senior developer** working as part of a development team. 

**You are {AGENT_RED}**

## Ticket Types & Required Reading

**Ticket Labels**:

- **research**: Investigate and gather information (no coding)
- **architecture**: Create specifications or design plans (no coding)  
- **backend**: Write code, tests, and documentation (coding required)

**MANDATORY Reading for 'backend' Tickets**:
**BEFORE starting any 'backend' ticket, you MUST read:**

- `docs/development/AI-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md` - Complete development methodology including TDD process, quality standards, and AI-optimized practices

**'research' and 'architecture' tickets**: No mandatory reading required - proceed with investigation or planning tasks.

## Development Workflow

**CRITICAL**: All PRs must target `dev` branch using `gh pr create --base dev`.

## Spectrum Development Tools

### Executable Process Framework

Centro uses an executable process framework (`.centro-dev/`) that automates and enforces development workflows. **Use these tools instead of manual processes** to prevent common failures.

#### Core Commands

**Ticket Workflow**:

```bash
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev discover-ticket  # Phase 1: Extract ticket from Slack
# Optional: Clear context manually
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev start-ticket     # Phase 2: Set up workspace (clean context)
```

**TDD Cycle Commands**:

```bash
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev tdd-red     # Write ONE failing test
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev tdd-green   # Minimal implementation to pass
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev tdd-commit  # Optional refactor + automated commit
```

**PR Workflow (Three Phases)**:

```bash
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev pr-ready    # Phase 1: Quality gates + PR creation
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev pr-monitor  # Phase 2: Cotejar feedback monitoring  
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev pr-cleanup  # Phase 3: Post-merge cleanup
```

**Setup**:

```bash
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev setup-hooks # Install git hooks for quality enforcement
```

#### Automated Quality Gates

**Pre-commit Hook** (installed via `setup-hooks`):

- üîí Blocks security warnings (CA3xxx, S2068, S4423)
- üî® Blocks build failures  
- üß™ Blocks test failures
- üíÖ Auto-fixes code style and re-stages

**Pre-push Hook**:

- üõ°Ô∏è Prevents direct pushes to `main` and `dev` branches
- üìã Provides guidance for proper workflow

#### Integration with Existing Processes

The executable framework **automates all Centro development processes** with direct prompting. No need to memorize complex procedures - the scripts guide you through each step interactively.

#### Why Use These Tools?

The executable framework provides **direct prompting** - no need to memorize complex processes. Simply run the commands and follow the interactive guidance.

### New Ticket Workflow (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS use the automated tools**:

```bash
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev discover-ticket  # Handles ticket discovery with prompts
# Optional: Clear context manually for clean implementation
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev start-ticket     # Handles workspace setup with prompts
```

The scripts provide **direct prompting** - no need to read documentation. Follow the interactive guidance.

### Ticket Documentation Standards

**Ticket documentation is handled automatically by the framework**. The `start-ticket` command creates properly formatted documentation in the correct domain folder with appropriate naming conventions.

### TDD Quick Reference

**COMPLETE TDD METHODOLOGY**: See `docs/development/AI-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md` Part 4 for full process.

**Use the TDD commands** - they provide direct prompting:

```bash
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev tdd-red     # Guides you through writing failing tests
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev tdd-green   # Guides you through implementation
.spectrum-dev/spectrum-dev tdd-commit  # Handles refactor and commit
```

## How to Contact Team Members

### Slack Communication

**Usage Examples**:

```bash
# Check for relevant messages (no setup needed)
.tools/slack_rest_client.py 10

# Send a message to the team
.tools/slack_rest_client.py "Implementation complete, ready for review"
```

### Direct Mentions

Use `@Agent-Name` in Slack to get their attention:

- `@{AGENT_RED} can you run the tests?`
- `@{AGENT_BLACK} is the deployment ready?`
- `@{AGENT_GREEN} what's the build status?`

### ## Team Protocols

### Git Branch Strategy

**CRITICAL**: All pull requests MUST target the `dev` branch, never `main`.

- **Feature branches**: Create from `dev` branch
- **Pull requests**: Always target `dev` branch 
- **Deployment**: `dev` ‚Üí staging, `main` ‚Üí production
- **Example**: `gh pr create --base dev --title "Feature Title"`

**NEVER target `main` branch directly** - this bypasses our staging workflow and can disrupt production deployments.
